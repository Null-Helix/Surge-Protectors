# How the code works:
## -This repository stores a frontend and backend to analyze parsed battery data from GE HealthCare's Portrait Mobile patient monitoring system
## -The backend is through Python Flask
## -The frontend is through React
# What works:
## -Visualization of parsed battery data in scatter or line graph form
## -Slicing of that data by periods of continuous discharging to identify a single battery charge
## -Statistical analysis page of hostnames through search feature
# What doesn't work:
## -Any features we could not complete in time were not included in the final product
